# es-query
[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

An utilitarian library for DOM manipulation using ECMAScript 7 Function Bind Syntax.

es-query is only compatible with IE8 or better.

## How to use
To use this library you need to install it with NPM using:
```bash
npm i -S es-query
```
Once you finish you can load it in your code with:
```javascript
import $ from 'es-query';
```
Or you can load only the required methods with:
```javascript
import { find, html, each } from 'es-query';
```
Then you can use it this way:
```javascript
document.querySelector('section')::$.find('p')::$.each(el => {
  el::$.html('Hello, world!');
});
```
Or if you only load some modules:
```javascript
document.querySelector('section')::find('p')::each(el => {
  el::html('Hello, world!');
});
```
The methods are made to work only with one element at time, so if you have an array of elements you has to use the method each() like in the example before.

## List of methods
All the methods works with the same syntax as jQuery.
